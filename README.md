# We_Rate_Dogs_Tweets-analysis
> Data wrangling and analysis tweets of @WeRateDogs Twitter's account.

[WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because ["they're good dogs Brent."](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent) WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.


The Data Wrangling process starts with gathering the datasets, assessing them, then cleaning for easy and correct analysis.
